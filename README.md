# Cologne_Website
  This is my second project using React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. I built this website to talk about something that I find very fun: colognes! I've been collecting colognes for a few months now and could talk forever about them, so I decided it would be a perfect hobby to create a website for.

  ## A little bit about this project:
  Things that went well:\
    The website works pretty well on mobile, which was a failure point on my last website\
    The website utilizes multiple pages, something I didn't do on the previous website\
    The styling on this website is far superior than my last website\
    I feel like the layout and the way I organized the .jsx files was much better than my first website\
    I actually have it published! Anyone with the link can view this website now, something I didn't do for my previous website

  Things that went poorly:\
    There are some small visual issues when using my iPhone to view the site\
    I feel I could have created a more interesting design

  Things I intend to improve:\
    I would like to add more functionality to the site. Mainly being clickable pictures that lead you to a cologne, this would look like a page for each cologne and some words about them each.
